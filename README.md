I am student at Instituto Superior Técnico of Universidade de Lisboa in Portugal. Currently working on my PhD as part of the APPLAuSE doctoral program which is managed by the Instituto de Plasmas e fusão Nuclear (IPFN).
My work is centered around developing high-power laser sources and some of their applications. 
I am mostly an experimentalist working at the Laboratory of Intense Lasers (L2I) in Lisbon, but I also perform simulations for the design of laser amplification systems and confirmation of experimental results.
At the time of writing (July 2024) I am spending a semester with the VULCAN team at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, United Kingdom, working on the front-end for the VULCAN 20-20 project.
